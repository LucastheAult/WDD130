    <p>I'm 19 years old in my freshman year college.</p>
    <p>Some hobbies that I have is that I play the guitar and play games with friends. I also love to learn new things.</p>
    <p>I am not married</p>
    <p>Advantages that I see with learning web fundamentals is that you can get more experience with coding and be able to apply it with other aspects of coding.</p>
    <p>The reason that I'm taking this course is because web design interests me and I can see myself having a career in it.</p>
    <p>What I hope to get out of this class is some knowledge on how to be more creative with code.</p>
    <p>With the skills I learned I hope that I can be able to go on my own and make my own websites for fun or professionally.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church for my whole life. A scripture that has  always been my favorite is 1st Nephi 3:7.</p>
